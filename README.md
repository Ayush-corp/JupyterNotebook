# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

Welcome to the "Data Science Tools and Ecosystem" repository! In this notebook, we will provide an overview of commonly used programming languages, libraries, and tools in the field of Data Science. Additionally, you will find examples of Markdown cell formatting, as well as code cell demonstrations containing lists, tables, and arithmetic expressions.

## Objectives

- Gain insights into the commonly used languages and libraries in the Data Science field.
- Learn Markdown syntax for creating formatted content.
- Explore examples of Python code cells containing arithmetic expressions.

## Overview

Data Science is a multifaceted field that leverages various tools, languages, and libraries to extract insights from data. Below, we summarize some of the key components of the Data Science ecosystem.

### Popular Languages for Data Science

- Python
- R
- Julia
- SQL
- Javascript

Data Scientists often work with a variety of programming languages, with Python and R being two of the most popular choices.

### Commonly Used Libraries

Data Scientists rely on a range of libraries to perform data analysis and machine learning tasks. Some of the commonly used libraries include:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow

These libraries provide essential functionality for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

### Data Science Tools

To facilitate Data Science work, professionals use a selection of tools, including:

- JupyterLab
- RStudio
- Anaconda
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

These tools offer integrated development environments (IDEs) and notebooks that streamline the data analysis and modeling process.

## Examples of Arithmetic Expressions

Let's explore some examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

```python
a = 10
b = 12
c = a * b
print(c)  # Output: 120

result1 = (3 * 4) + 5  # This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
print(result1)  # Output: 17

result2 = 200 / 60  # This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
print(result2)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335
```
